page 71: You mention that we can only print the body of a Definition, not a Theorem. I don't think this is true, but I may be mistaken. My understanding was that we can print either body, and Definition/Theorem are synonyms. Now, if the Definition or Theorem is ended with Qed instead of Defined, then the body will not be accessible to computation. 

page 71: in two places: "such program" -> "... such programs" or "...such a program" 

page 72: "account to" -> "amount to" ?

page 72: You use the phrase "definitional equality" in a way that is confusing to me. I think of definitional equality as synonymous with "convertability" or "equal by definition" or "equal by computation". It is something built in to the metatheory that is only indirectly accessible from inside Coq. You use the phrase only one other place in the book, on page 55, where your usage seems to agree with mine. But here, you seem to be suggesting that a definitional equality can be a proposition within Coq, which, in my view, it cannot. Only the propositional equality (as defined by an inductive type definition) can be a proposition in Coq. I think if you just said "extensional equality" or even just "equality" instead of "definitional equality" everywhere on this page, that would be correct in my view. Otherwise, maybe you could add a footnote explaining what you mean by "definitional" here that is different from page 55. 

page 72: It seems the constructor IsOne of isPrime is redundant with IsOther, since IsOther does not require n to be greater than 1. Also it is a little confusing since MathComp.prime does not consider 1 to be prime (people always disagree on this :\ ).

page 73: extra space before "coercion"

page 73: extra space before comma in "Haskell ,"

page 74, footnote 5: "inf the proof" -> "in the proof"

There are a couple places where a one-line proof starts with "by" and ends with "=>//", but my impression is that these are the same except that "by" asserts that the proof is done. Is it typical style to use both instead of just "by"?
