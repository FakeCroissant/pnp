(** * %\texttt{Prop} versus \emph{bool}%

TODO: Emphasize that in Prop you can use quantifiers, whereas [bool]
is as expressive as simple propositional logic (which is its strength,
thank to Coq's terminating computations)

(** * %The \emph{reflect} type family%

Construct a simple reflection procedure for some simple user-specific
connective.

(** * Using conditionals in predicates

(** * Case analysing on a boolean assumption

(** * Types with decidable equalities
