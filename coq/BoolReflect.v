(** * [Prop] versus [bool]

TODO: Emphasize that in Prop you can use quantifiers, whereas [bool]
is as expressive as simple propositional logic (which is its strength,
thank to Coq's terminating computations)

(** * The [reflect] data type

Construct a simple reflection procedure for some simple user-specific
connective.

(** * Using conditionals in predicates

TODO: Emphasize that in Prop you can use quantifiers, whereas [bool]
is as expressive as simple propositional logic (which is its strength,
thank to Coq's terminating computations)

(** * Types with decidable equalities

TODO: Emphasize that in Prop you can use quantifiers, whereas [bool]
is as expressive as simple propositional logic (which is its strength,
