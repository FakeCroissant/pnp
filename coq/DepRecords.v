(**  

In this chapter we will learn how to encode the reasoning about common
algebraic data structures in Coq. In particular, we will meet some old
friends from the course of abstract algebra: monoids and PCMs. 
*)

(** * A basic mathematical structure: monoid *)

(**

Here, we define the monoids and prove a number of properties about
them. We will take natural numbers and lists as instances.

* Further reading

We recommend the interested authors to take a look at Chapter 1 of
%Fran\c{c}ois% Garillot's PhD dissertation for more examples of
mathematical data structure encoding in Coq/SSReflect%~\cite{Garillot:PhD}%.
